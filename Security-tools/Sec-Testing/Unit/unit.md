> TestNG vs JUnit
Both Testng and Junit are Testing framework used for Unit Testing. TestNG is similar to JUnit. Few more functionalities are added to it that makes TestNG more powerful than Junit, like TestNG support dependency test.

>MSTEST vs NUnit
MsTest is a native unit testing library that comes with Visual Studio from Microsoft
NUnit is an extra Nuget package that needs to be installed on top and interact with the APIs of Visual Studio. Nunit likely doesn’t have direct integration into the native APIs like MsTest does

> Mocha vs Jest & Jasmine
Jest is an open-source unit testing framework developed by Facebook. Mocha is a JavaScript testing framework that also supports Node.js. In addition, it provides developers with a base test framework with options such as assertion, mocking, and spy libraries. As a result, Mocha is one of the most flexible JavaScript testing libraries。
Jest is a testing platform built on Jasmine, which originated from Facebook. It offers a selection of advanced features that makes testing just a little bit easier. Jasmine provides a clean and simple API for end-to-end JavaScript testing with Node.js or in the browser. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks, but does integrate well with them
