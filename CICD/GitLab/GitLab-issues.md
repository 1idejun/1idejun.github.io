### [Interactive Web Terminals]
  
>- a method for debugging with SSH
>- Shared runners on GitLab.com do not provide an interactive web terminal
>- The docker executor does not keep running after the build script is finished. At that point, the terminal automatically disconnects and does not wait for the user to finish. Please follow [this issue] for updates on improving this behavior.
